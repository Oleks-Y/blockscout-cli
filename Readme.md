# Blockscout-cli

This is a simple command line interface for interacting with the Blockscout Explorer. Don't expect much.

## Installation

If you're brave enough, that's what you can do:

```bash
$ git clone
$ cd blockscout-cli
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/blockscout-cli /usr/local/bin
```

Enjoy! ðŸš€
